									<h3>Education</h3>
									<p><!--<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When deciding where to attend for my undergraduate degree, there was no question that I wanted to go to Northeastern University. In December 2018 I applied to Northeastern and unknowingly also submitted an application to the NUin program. Upon receiving my acceptance letter to Northeastern University I was filled with complete joy, however I was quickly taken aback when realizing that I had also been accepted to NUin. The NUin program allows students to study abroad during there first semester meaning that they will not be on Northeastern's campus during their Freshman fall semester. After plenty of thought and talks with friends and family, I decided to take a leap of faith and commit to this journey. I was given the option to study in either, Ireland, Australia or Greece and due to my Irish roots, there was no question that I was going to choose Dublin. While in Ireland, I learned so much about Irish culture, European lifestyles and what it's like to take college level courses. Upon returning from Ireland, I got settled fairly quickly on Northeastern's campus and had a new profound sense of confidence.</p>
									<h4>Courses</h4>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Northeastern, I completed a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Enigneering and Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. This combination of studies allowed me to learn about both software and hardware components involved in computer systems. At Northeastern, I took many different styles of courses. Some of the most relavent to my career can be found below:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Circuits and Signals: Biomedical Applications</li>
										<li>Complex Algorithms</li>
										<li>Computer Architecture</li>
										<li>Computer Systems</li>
										<li>Cornerstone of Engineering</li>
										<li>Digital Design</li>
										<li>Discrete Structures</li>
										<li>Embedded Design</li>
										<li>Engineering Capstone</li>
										<li>Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence</li>
										<li>Fundamentals of Computer Science</li>
										<li>Fundamentals of Networks</li>
										<li>Hardware-Software Codesign for FPGA-Based Systems</li>
										<li>Introduction to C++</li>
										<li>Logic and Computation</li>
										<li>Object Oriented Design</li>
										<li>Software Engineering</li>
									  </ul>
									  <h4>Clubs & Activities</h4>
									  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also participated in various clubs throughout my time at Northeastern University. Through participating in clubs, I was able to meet new people, strengthen some of my technicals skills and learn more about my interests within the world of Computer Science. The clubs I participated in are listed below:</p>
									  <ul>
										<li>Entrepreneurship Club</li>
										<li>Game Development Club</li>
										<li>Husky Hunt</li>
										<li>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</li>
										<li>Intramural Soccer</li>
									  </ul>
									  <h4>Co-op Experience</h4>
									<p><!--<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northeastern University allows students the opportunity to partake in experiential learning. Students can participate in co-ops which means they can apply, interview and eventually work with companies as a full time employee over the course of 6 months.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first co-op was at a universty in Boston named MCPHS. There I worked as a Network Support Technician and gained valuable experience working in a technical engineering role. While at MCPHS I worked on improving an existing ticketing system and accelerating efficiency of internal team processes. I learned a lot about large scale network systems and was able to gain initial footing in my engineering career.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my second co-op I was able to get a position as a Software Engineer at Hologic. At Hologic, I worked with a large group of interdisciplinary engineers on a fluid management system for hysteroscopic procedures. I learned a lot of version control through GitHub and strengthened my skills writing code in C++. I worked on creating a custom shell allowing test engineers to gather critical data and information about the system. I am truly thankful for my amazing coworkers throughout my 7 months at Hologic and I had a blast working with my team.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stuck with the medical device industry for my third and final co-op and was able to work at Abbott for 6 months. There, I was able to lead the development of a data extraction and analysis application for a new LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) that was being developed in Python. This application was critical to the development of the product and will also be used by people on many different teams. My application was made to fit the needs of the Software team, Electrical team, Quality Assurance team, Device Verification team and also doctors out in the field who are using the device!</p>
