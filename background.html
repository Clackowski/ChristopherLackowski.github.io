									<h3>Education</h3>
									<p><!--<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When deciding which college to attend for my undergraduate degree, Northeastern University was my top choice. In December of 2018 I applied to Northeastern and unknowingly also submitted an application to a program called NUin. Upon receiving my acceptance letter to Northeastern University I was filled with complete joy, however I quickly became confused after realizing I had also been accepted into the NUin program. In short, the NUin program allows students to study abroad during their first semester which means that they will not be living on Northeastern's campus during their Freshman fall semester. After plenty of thought and discussions with friends and family, I decided to take a leap of faith and commit to this journey. In my acceptance letter, I was given the option to study in either Ireland, Australia or Greece, but due to my Irish roots, Dublin was the obvious choice. While in Ireland, I learned a lot about Irish culture, European lifestyles and the rigor of college level courses. After completing the 4 month long adventure and returning from Ireland, I was excited to live on Northeastern's campus in Boston and establish my new home where I would be spending the next 5 years. I can confidently say that my acceptance into the NUin program and my time at Northeastern University was a catalyst for giving me a new profound sense of confidence.</p>
									<h4>Courses</h4>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Northeastern, I completed a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Enigneering and Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. This combination of studies allowed me to learn about both software and hardware components involved in computer systems. At Northeastern, I took many different styles of courses. Some of the courses that are most relavent to my career can be found below:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Circuits and Signals: Biomedical Applications</li>
										<li>Complex Algorithms</li>
										<li>Computer Architecture</li>
										<li>Computer Systems</li>
										<li>Cornerstone of Engineering</li>
										<li>Digital Design</li>
										<li>Discrete Structures</li>
										<li>Embedded Design</li>
										<li>Engineering Capstone</li>
										<li>Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence</li>
										<li>Fundamentals of Computer Science</li>
										<li>Fundamentals of Networks</li>
										<li>Hardware-Software Codesign for FPGA-Based Systems</li>
										<li>Introduction to C++</li>
										<li>Logic and Computation</li>
										<li>Object Oriented Design</li>
										<li>Software Engineering</li>
									  </ul>
									  <h4>Clubs & Activities</h4>
									  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also participated in various clubs throughout my time at Northeastern University. Through participating in clubs, I was able to meet new people, strengthen some of my technicals skills and learn more about my interests within the world of Computer Science. The clubs I participated in are listed below:</p>
									  <ul>
										<li>Entrepreneurship Club</li>
										<li>Game Development Club</li>
										<li>Husky Hunt</li>
										<li>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</li>
										<li>Intramural Soccer</li>
									  </ul>
									  <h4>Co-op Experience</h4>
									<p><!--<span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northeastern University allows students the opportunity to partake in experiential learning. Students can participate in co-ops allowing them to apply, interview and work with companies as a full time employee over the course of 6 months.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first co-op was at a universty in Boston named MCPHS. Throughout my time there, I worked as a Network Support Technician and gained valuable experience working in a technical engineering role. While at MCPHS I worked on improving an existing ticketing system and accelerating efficiency of internal team processes. I learned a lot about large scale network systems and was able to gain initial footing in my engineering career.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my second co-op, I worked as a Software Engineer in a large medical device company named Hologic. At Hologic, I worked with a large group of interdisciplinary engineers on a fluid management system for hysteroscopic procedures. I gathered important knowledge surrounding GitHub's version control system and strengthened my skills writing embedded C++ code. I worked on creating a custom shell allowing test engineers to gather critical data and information about the system. I am truly thankful for my amazing coworkers throughout my 7 months at Hologic. I had a blast working with my research and development team.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continued on my path with the medical device industry for my third and final co-op and chose to work as a Software Engineer at Abbott Laboratories for 6 months. During my time at Abbott, I was able to lead the development of a data extraction and analysis application for a new version of a LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) that was in the key stages of development using Python. This application was critical to the development of the product and offered features that were used by multiple different teams in the Heart Failure Division. It was developed to address the needs of the Software team, Electrical team, Quality Assurance team, Device Verification team and onsite doctors who needed instant insights about the status of the device while it's being used!</p>
