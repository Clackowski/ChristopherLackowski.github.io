									<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Fall 2023, I took a Software Engineering class through Northeastern. In this class, the students were placed into groups of 4 and tasked with adding new features to an already existing multiplayer workplace simulation web application using an agile development process. Players can join different worlds where they can interact with other players in a variety of ways. They can have conversations through text or voicechat, explore new areas together and watch videos. As a result of this limited functionality, we decided to add a few new features.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to add a game area to the world which lets players play TicTacToe against eachother. We ensured that the code that we wrote was extensible, so that new games would easily be able to be added in the future. Also, we implemented an economy allowing players to gain CoveyCoins. They can earn CovyeCoins buy interacting with a Daily Coin Collector which can gives the player a random number of coins every 24 hours. Also, they can earn coins by winning games against other players.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="./images/Poster.png" alt="" /></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we wanted the players to have things they could do with their CoveyCoins, we also added shops and trading areas to the world. Players can interact with the shops to purchase hats that can be worn on their player models. An on-screen inventory was added to show which hats they own. We created another way for players to interact buy developing trading areas, so players can swap hats they they own. Lastly, we integrated all of the players' data with an Azure database, so that everything is persistent upon leaving and rejoining a world.</p>
